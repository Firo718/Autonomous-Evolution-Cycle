# Autonomous Evolution Cycle

A complete self-evolution framework that transforms reactive assistants into proactive partners in continuous improvement and autonomous growth.

## 🚀 Features

- **Intelligent Task Generation**: Automatically generates daily tasks based on previous completion status and free activity discoveries
- **Master Priority Respect**: Absolute priority hierarchy ensuring human instructions come first  
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time monitoring with deviation analysis and automatic correction
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Automatic memory creation and pattern recognition for continuous learning
- **Heartbeat Integration**: Zero-progress detection and automatic task activation
- **Shell Automation (Optional)**: Complete bash implementation for advanced users

## 📥 Installation

### Standard Installation (SKILL.md only)
```bash
# Create skill directory
mkdir -p ~/.moltbot/skills/autonomous-evolution-cycle

# Download skill file
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Firo718/Autonomous-Evolution-Cycle/main/SKILL.md > ~/.moltbot/skills/autonomous-evolution-cycle/SKILL.md
```

### Advanced Installation (with Shell automation)
```bash
# Download all files including automation scripts
mkdir -p ~/.moltbot/skills/autonomous-evolution-cycle
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Firo718/Autonomous-Evolution-Cycle/main/SKILL.md > ~/.moltbot/skills/autonomous-evolution-cycle/SKILL.md
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Firo718/Autonomous-Evolution-Cycle/main/package.json > ~/.moltbot/skills/autonomous-evolution-cycle/package.json
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Firo718/Autonomous-Evolution-Cycle/main/HEARTBEAT.md > ~/.moltbot/skills/autonomous-evolution-cycle/HEARTBEAT.md

# Optional: Download automation scripts
mkdir -p ~/.moltbot/skills/autonomous-evolution-cycle/scripts
# Download individual scripts as needed
```

## 🔧 Integration

Seamlessly integrates with 5 core skills:
1. **Infrastructure Automation** (task execution)
2. **Agent Memory Research** (knowledge storage)  
3. **Compost Method** (pattern extraction)
4. **StratMD** (strategic alignment)
5. **Structured Logging** (observability)

## 🎯 Usage

### Manual Mode (Standard)
- "start autonomous evolution cycle"
- "plan my daily tasks autonomously"
- "implement self-evolution loop" 
- "generate autonomous work plan"
- "run continuous improvement cycle"

### Automated Mode (Advanced)
```bash
# Initialize system
./scripts/aec.sh init

# Generate daily task plan  
./scripts/aec.sh plan

# Check status
./scripts/aec.sh status

# Run complete cycle
./scripts/aec.sh run
```

## 📊 Real-World Impact

- Solves the "progress = 0" problem with heartbeat-based accountability
- Eliminates waiting for external triggers with immediate execution  
- Balances safety and autonomy with smart safeguards
- Provides both manual and automated operation modes
